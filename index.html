          students with lessons online. Currently, we have lessons for Java, Python, and Web Development(HTML/CSS/JS) on our
          youtube channel, so that students can continue to learn and follow on without in-person lessons</h3>

            Junior Coding League has made a profound impact in the lives of our students, which was exactly the goal
            that we started out with. Not only have we taught hundreds of students how to program, we have taught them
            how to give back to their own communities by enabling them to identify and solve the problems that they face
            in their everyday lives.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1000ms">
            That being said, though, Junior Coding League will work to bring its program to as many new and underpriviledged
            students globally as possible. We are currently working to set up chapters in several international countries,
            namely India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria! We plan to continue our free lessons in these nations
            and continue to allow students to discover a passion for programming.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1200ms">
            Finally, for students that live in developed nations like the United States, we hope to create an early exposure to programming.
            Our extensive research has shown that parents are often afraid to enroll their children in programming courses because
            they fear students may not be able to easily grasp concepts or than the classes cost too much. This is why our classes are not
            only free, but all of our mentors are extensively trained and vetted. In the future we plan to contiue expanding our volunteers as we grow.
